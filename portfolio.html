        <div class="back">
          <h1 style="margin:0px;">* The second hackathon I ever attended, CruzHacks 2020, had 450 participants. 81% of the attendees were students at California State University Santa Cruz. It is the largest annual Hackathon in Santa Cruz.
<br>* For CruzHacks, my team and I designed a learning platform called Big Ben. Big Ben aims to teach financial literacy to kids 7 and up. Leading up to the hackathon, my siblings and I wrote lessons concerning finance. During the competition we designed the website and coded it. We won the Tech Cares sector of the hackathon.</h1>

          <h1 style="margin:0px;">After winning CruzHacks, Santa Cruz Works invited us to present Big Ben at their conference. Kierra, my sister, made the presentation and redesigned the entire website. Kenji (my brother) and I recoded the entire project and added the reading difficulty feature. The reading difficulty feature introduced simpler and more advanced versions original lessons. Users would be able to choose what difficulty they wanted to read at.</h1>

        <div class="back">
          <h1 style="margin:0px; padding: 0px;">* The third hackathon I ever attended, Z-Hacks 2020, had 360 participants. This hackathon was different because it is the first hackathon in the world to ever accept non-coding projects.
<br>* We wanted to create a platform that had a massive impact on the world. We decided on the new project, Storiology. Storiology is actually an older idea that we had since we were 7, 7, and 9 years old. It is based on the observation that when kids are hospitalized, instead of offering the kids interesting books to occupy them, hospitals generally give them toys and video games. We wanted ill kids to build good reading habits opposed to being hooked on toys, which is the focus of Storiology; kids reading for sick kids in the hospital. We designed a platform that had to different account options, user and volunteer. Users could choose which book they wanted to be read to them and a volunteer can do it. The software would help them get into touch and they can have a fun time reading together.</h1>

      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <div class="skinterest">
      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">HTML</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">HTML is a front end coding language that is widely used to make websites. I got interested into HTML because I wanted to get into making websites. At first, I didn’t know much about it, but it was easy to learn and get better due to the intuitive structure. My first websites were very crude and simple, but they rapidly got better.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skinterest">
      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">CSS</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">CSS is a front end coding language that builds directly upon HTML to make websites look stylish. CSS is what allows for fancy hover effects, element positioning, colors, headers, footers, sticky objects, parallax scroll, and more! I was able to use this to make my websites look better than ever.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skinterest">
      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">JS</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">JavaScript is a scripting language. Its main use is to manipulate HTML websites so you can interact. My main use for JS is accessing a library made by Google called Firebase. Also, I used it to make a Chrome Extension that customizes the Youtube viewing experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skinterest">
      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Chess</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">I started picking up Chess again during December of 2020 because I had nothing else to do on the RV trip we were on. I played a lot of chess with my siblings to occupy my time. Since we didn't have a chess timer, I made one myself using HTML and JS.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skinterest">
      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Tennis</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">I started playing tennis at the age of 7 years old. I learned the basics such as the terminology and the ruleset, but I didn’t get much better. At age 9, I started playing with a coach named coach Manhal. Coach Manhal helped develop my form and strategy. After a year, we moved out of the area, so we stopped playing tennis for 2 years. Then I started playing again with a coach named Coach Stephanie. Coach Manhal drilled the form into me so hard that even after the 2 years, is stilled played well. Coach Stephanie helped develop my form further, but she had to move out of California, so out training stopped. Then I moved back to the area with Coach Manhal and I currently train with him.</p>

    <div class="skinterest">
      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Mythology</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">I picked up my love for Greek Mythology with the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan. Percy Jackson helped me get into it and develop a love far all mythologies with it's simple ideas and funny humour. I won a gold Medal in the National Mythology Exam 2019 for a perfect score. I am also interested in Roman, Norse, and Egyptian mythology.</p>

    <div class="skinterest">
      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Gaming</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 0px; width: 80vw;">The first game console I got was the Nintendo Wii. The Wii has a game called Super Smash Bros. Brawl, I instantly fell in love with it. For a while I played Roblox on mobile and PC. For my 11th birthday, I got Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube. I wanted this game for a while because, though it’s older (dating back to 2004), it has a much more colorful competitive scene. I got into competitive Smash Melee which is much more entertaining than Smash Brawl. Also, I got Minecraft when I got Melee which I also play often. In Minecraft I specialize in 1.8.9 PvP. On the 2021 new years, I got the Nintendo Switch and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.</p>
