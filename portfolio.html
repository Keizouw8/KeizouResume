          <h1 style="margin:0px;">* The second hackathon I ever attended, CruzHacks 2020, had 450 participants. 81% of the attendees were students at California State University Santa Cruz. It is the largest annual Hackathon in Santa Cruz.
<br>* For CruzHacks, my team and I designed a learning platform called Big Ben. Big Ben aims to teach financial literacy to kids 7 and up. Leading up to the hackathon, my siblings and I wrote lessons concerning finance. During the competition we designed the website and coded it. We won the Tech Cares sector of the hackathon.</h1>

          <h1 style="margin:0px;">After winning CruzHacks, Santa Cruz Works invited us to present Big Ben at their conference. Kierra, my sister, made the presentation and redesigned the entire website. Kenji (my brother) and I recoded the entire project and added the reading difficulty feature. The reading difficulty feature introduced simpler and more advanced versions original lessons. Users would be able to choose what difficulty they wanted to read at.</h1>

        <div class="back">
          <h1 style="margin:0px; padding: 0px;">* The third hackathon I ever attended, Z-Hacks 2020, had 360 participants. This hackathon was different because it is the first hackathon in the world to ever accept non-coding projects.
<br>* We wanted to create a platform that had a massive impact on the world. We decided on the new project, Storiology. Storiology is actually an older idea that we had since we were 7, 7, and 9 years old. It is based on the observation that when kids are hospitalized, instead of offering the kids interesting books to occupy them, hospitals generally give them toys and video games. We wanted ill kids to build good reading habits opposed to being hooked on toys, which is the focus of Storiology; kids reading for sick kids in the hospital. We designed a platform that had to different account options, user and volunteer. Users could choose which book they wanted to be read to them and a volunteer can do it. The software would help them get into touch and they can have a fun time reading together.</h1>
